## Hello!

I am Alexander (Alex), and I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia with a B.sc in computer science. Throughout my education, I have sought every opportunity to develop my skills and explore enticing fields within and outside my major. While I have acquired the most experience in full-stack development, I am also fascinated by data science and artificial intelligence. My honours research, internship, and project experiences have given me the opportunity to apply my skills, dive head-first into new domains, and work with peers who have diverse talents.

## Skills
**Frontend**: React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS (currently learning Tailwind)

**Backend**: Typescript, Node.js, Express.js, Java (proficient but with less experience than the others)

**Database**: MySQL, Excel, Google Sheets

**Data Analysis/Visualization**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, R, Jupyter

**Machine Learning/AI**: Pytorch, Huggingface Transformers, Scikit-learn

## Open to

I am currently searching for a full-time position, and am excited for future opportunities! While I am primaily searching for full-stack/frontend/backend developer roles for the sake of familiarity, I am not hard-set on any particular career path. I am a voracious learner who always seeks a challenge, and would love to further deepen and apply my skills in any of my forementioned interests.

In the meantime, I am working on a couple independent projects. One is my personal website, and the other is a Chrome extension for price checking Facebook Marketplace deals and detecting potential scams (Marketplace-extension repository). If you have a project you are passionate about and are open to collaborating, please shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I am also open to contract work.
